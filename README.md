# AI Garbage Classifier
This AI Garbage Classifier is a powerful tool developed to identify and classify six types of materials commonly found in waste: Cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic, and trash. It has been trained on a diverse dataset, which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mostafaabla/garbage-classification).

## Uses of this AI
  The are numerous uses of this AI and it has the potential to make a significant positive impact on waste management and recycling processes. Some of its key applications and benefits include:

- ### 1. Automated Waste Sorting
    One of the most immediate and practical uses of this AI is in automated waste sorting systems. Recycling facilities and waste management centers can integrate this AI into their processing lines, allowing for the efficient separation of recyclable materials (Cardboard, glass, metal, paper, and plastic) from non-recyclable waste. This automation reduces the need for manual labor, making the sorting process faster, more accurate, and cost-effective.

- ### 2. Environmental Impact
    By enabling precise waste sorting, this AI contributes to minimizing the environmental impact of waste disposal. Separating recyclable materials from trash not only reduces the amount of waste sent to landfills but also promotes recycling and the reutilization of valuable resources. This has direct and positive consequences for the environment, such as reduced pollution and conservation of natural resources.

- ### 3. Scalability
  The AI Garbage Classifier is highly scalable and adaptable to different settings. It can be integrated into existing recycling and waste management infrastructures with ease. Whether you are running a small recycling facility or managing waste for an entire city, this AI can be implemented at various levels to enhance recycling efforts and sustainability.

## Setup

### 1. Install required packages
   Begin by running the following command to install the necessary Python packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
### 2. Start the Server
  After successfully installing the required packages, start the server by running the following command: `py server.py`. This will initiate the server, and you can access the AI through a web interface on your local machine by visiting [localhost](http://127.0.0.1:5000).
